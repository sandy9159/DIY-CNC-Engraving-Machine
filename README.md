Hello friends in this post Iâ€™ll show how I made my own mini DIY CNC engraving cum Milling machine using Arduino and GRBL CNC shield.

The frame of machine is made up of 12mm plywood which is very strong and easy to work with.


I have used 500W spindle for this mini cnc engraving machine which have enough power to work done.


working area of this machine is 120 x 120 x 30 mm.
I have tested this machine on Acrylic sheet, PCB, Wood and works fine.


I have not tested with aluminium yet, but yes for shaloow engraving with high quality end mill surely we achieve good result on aluminium as well.

So let see further in this post how to build this mini powerful diy cnc engraving machine.
